"# TagRedactor" 
The task was to create a simply online word redactor that allows to write/modify any text/list or table, for example - change font style/weight or color, background etc. Also site should 
have been realized on clear JS without any libraries/frameworks. All parts of project was written by myself. I started to create a site from making a simple design that contains only 3 forms for work: form that contains users text, form that allows editing and styling users information and form that allows to add new elements such as lists or tables. Next step was creating users interface that controls apearing/hiding this forms and adding features for all using elements.At present time all function are ready for work. Now im working at redesigning and adaptivity 
of the project.
